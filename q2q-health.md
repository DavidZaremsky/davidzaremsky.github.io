## Overview  
Q2Q Health was a Rhode Island–based health tech startup focused on helping users—especially older adults—avoid dangerous medication interactions and better understand chronic health conditions like diabetes. The company was founded by nurse-educator Roberta Powell after a near-fatal medication error during her own cancer treatment, inspiring her to create an app that could translate medical data and flag harmful drug combinations ([PBN](https://pbn.com/q2q-app-can-spot-errors-in-medication-dosages), [RIC](https://our.ric.edu/news-events/news/medical-data-isnt-problem-understanding-it)).

I worked on Q2Q Health through **Generation Impact**, a volunteer social impact consultancy I co-founded to connect cross-functional professionals with purpose-driven startups. Over 9 months, our team delivered research, facilitation, UX artifacts, and a working React prototype.

## Problem  
Each year, medication-related adverse drug events lead to over **100,000 deaths** in the U.S., disproportionately affecting older adults who often manage multiple prescriptions ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/medicationsafety/adult_adversedrugevents.html)). Despite the danger, many tools to prevent these interactions are either inaccessible or too complex for everyday users. Q2Q Health aimed to change that with a simple, intuitive app that translated test results, flagged interactions, and offered educational resources—especially for users managing diabetes.

## Process  

### Team Building & Leadership  
- As sourcing chair of Generation Impact, I identified Q2Q Health as a candidate project and assembled a team of developers, designers, and marketers.  
- Led project planning, standups, and cross-functional collaboration using Trello and Teams.

### User Research & Discovery  
- Facilitated remote Design Sprint-style workshops via Miro to define user needs and pain points.  
- Created personas and user stories based on target users: seniors and caregivers managing chronic illnesses.

### Design & Prototyping  
- Designed wireframes in Figma for key screens including login and medication input flow.  
- Delivered a React-based working prototype with user login functionality, handed off to the client for continued development.  
- Documented a technical roadmap and UX recommendations for future iterations.

## Challenges  
- No funding or technical team in-house; all work was performed by volunteers.  
- The founder was non-technical, requiring extra clarity and facilitation.  
- Entering a competitive market where large players like CVS Health already had similar tools ([NEMIC](https://nemic.org/news/2020/07/07/2020-7-7-q2q-health-becomes-activate-fellow-a-seed-funding-preparation-program-supported-by-rhode-island-commerce)).

## Tools & Methods  
Miro, Figma, React, Microsoft Teams, Trello, Design Sprints, User Story Mapping.

## Outcome  
✅ Donated over **300 hours** of expert product, design, and development labor.  
✅ Delivered a functional prototype and design assets to support next-stage development.  
✅ Enabled Q2Q Health to advance its public health mission with minimal overhead.

## Generation Impact Context  
Generation Impact was created by alumni of the One Young World conference to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals through skilled volunteerism. As a founding member, I led project sourcing and matched social enterprises with vetted product teams. Q2Q Health was one of our flagship partnerships, where I also contributed directly as the product and design lead.

## Key Takeaways  
- Real-world design constraints—limited funding, non-technical founders, and public health stakes—demanded clear communication and lean methods.  
- Structured sprints and research artifacts helped clarify scope and unify the team.  
- Even early-stage prototypes can unlock momentum for mission-driven health tech startups.
