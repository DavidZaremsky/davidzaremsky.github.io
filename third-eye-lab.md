### **ðŸ”¬ 3rd Eye Lab Research**  
ðŸ“… **2 Years** | **UX Research & Physical Prototyping**  

## Overview  
In my time at the 3rd Eye Lab, I focused on conducting in-depth **user research** and creating a **haptic prototype** to assist people with low vision or blindness in everyday activities. The goal was to enhance their ability to navigate through tasks such as grocery shopping with more independence and confidence.  

## Problem  
People with visual impairments face numerous challenges when performing tasks that rely heavily on visual cues. Traditional navigation tools, such as mobile apps, do not always meet their needs in real-world environments.  

## Process  

### **User Research & Insights**  
- Conducted **qualitative interviews** with blind and low vision participants to understand their pain points.  
- Identified core challenges, including difficulties in locating items on store shelves, navigating aisles, and understanding product labels.  

### **Prototyping & Testing**  
- Developed a **haptic prototype** that provided physical feedback to guide users through the store. The prototype used **vibrations and directional cues** to lead them toward the correct products.  
- Conducted **usability testing** with participants, iterating on the design based on their feedback and ensuring the product was both effective and intuitive.  

### **Assistive Technology Integration**  
- Explored **assistive technology solutions** and how they could be integrated with the prototype for a more seamless user experience.  
- Focused on **affordability and practicality**, ensuring the solution could be used in everyday settings without the need for expensive equipment or specialized tools.  

## Outcome  
âœ… **Successful user testing** showed increased independence for participants during grocery shopping.  
âœ… Prototype demonstrated potential for further development into a fully functional assistive device.  
âœ… **Positive feedback** on haptic feedback as an intuitive solution for real-world navigation.  

## Key Takeaways  
- **Empathy-driven design** is essential when working with underrepresented user groups.  
- **Prototyping and iterative testing** are key to creating functional, user-centered solutions.  
- **Assistive technology** has the power to dramatically improve independence for individuals with disabilities, and thoughtful design can make it more accessible.
