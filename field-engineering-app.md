# Transforming FX2: Research, Design Systems, and Cross-Team Collaboration  

## Overview  
FX2 is a critical application for field engineers repairing medical equipment. My work on FX2 focused on user research, design system improvements, and fostering collaboration between UX and engineering teams. My earlier work on AgentX (a dispatching tool) gave me a deep understanding of the broader service ecosystem, allowing me to design with a holistic perspective.  

## Problem  
Field engineers needed a more efficient way to track tasks, manage repairs, and comply with regulatory requirements. The existing system was fragmented and inconsistent, leading to usability issues and wasted time.  

## Process  

### **User Research & Insights**  
- Conducted **weekly interviews** with field engineers to identify pain points.  
- Synthesized insights into key UX issues: poor task visibility, inefficient workflows, and lack of standardization.  
- Leveraged knowledge from **AgentX** to align workflows between dispatchers and engineers.  

### **Design System & UI Standardization**  
- Created **a unified design system** to ensure consistency across FX2 and related apps.  
- Developed **modular components** to streamline development and improve usability.  
- Standardized layouts and workflows, reducing cognitive load for engineers.  

### **Collaboration & Influence**  
- **Ran weekly feedback sessions** with stakeholders to align UX and business goals.  
- Worked closely with developers to implement **efficient, accessible designs**.  
- Advocated for **user-first design principles**, leading to better adoption by global teams.  

## Outcome  
✅ **Meaningful reduction** in task completion time due to improved UI efficiency.  
✅ **Positive feedback** from field engineers on ease of use.  
✅ **Established a scalable design system** used across multiple applications.  

## Key Takeaways  
- **Research-driven design** ensured the product met real user needs.  
- **Design system implementation** improved long-term consistency and maintainability.  
- **Cross-team collaboration** was critical in driving UX adoption across the organization.
