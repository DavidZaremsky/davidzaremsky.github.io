## Overview  
FX2 is GE Healthcare’s global field service application, used by engineers to repair and maintain medical equipment across hospitals and clinics. My work focused on in-person user research, a complete UX overhaul, and the creation of a robust design system. Prior experience with the dispatch call center software gave me a full view of the end-to-end repair lifecycle—informing improvements that connected technicians and support staff more effectively.

## Problem  
FX2 was nearing end-of-life and plagued by systemic UX issues. Field engineers consistently rated the tool poorly, citing confusing interfaces, workflow friction, and poor mobile performance. Because it wasn't built on a native platform, data loss and sync issues were common—impacting compliance logs and task tracking. The embedded web calendar was outdated and slow, leading to scheduling breakdowns in high-pressure hospital environments. A ground-up redesign was needed to restore trust and improve field effectiveness.

## Process  

### **User Research & Insights**  
- Conducted **in-person shadowing** of field engineers at hospitals to observe real workflows and constraints.  
- Led regular interviews to gather pain points and validate early design concepts.  
- Mapped the full service journey, including dispatch coordination, to ensure alignment across tools.

### **Design System & UI Standardization**  
- Created and scaled a **modular design system** used across FX2 and related GE Healthcare tools.  
- Delivered accessible, mobile-friendly components that improved consistency and reduced engineering time.  
- Standardized workflows to reduce training time, improve data quality, and minimize cognitive load.

### **Collaboration & Influence**  
- Facilitated **weekly cross-functional design reviews** with stakeholders from product, engineering, QA, and compliance.  
- Partnered closely with front-end engineers to implement performant React components.  
- Championed **user-first thinking** across product and leadership, improving adoption across global teams.

## Outcome  
✅ FX2 now supports over **8,000 field engineers** globally and is currently in active production.  
✅ Delivered features (e.g. offline mode) that contributed to **$1.5M/year in savings** and **82% mobile adoption** across LATAM and EMEA.  
✅ Created a design system still in use across multiple GE Healthcare service apps.  
✅ FX2 underpins a significant portion of GE Healthcare’s **$8B+ annual service revenue**, making it one of the company’s most mission-critical platforms.

## Key Takeaways  
- **Ethnographic research** in high-stakes hospital environments led to actionable UX improvements rooted in real workflows.  
- Building a **design system from scratch** empowered both design and engineering teams to work faster and more consistently.  
- **Enterprise UX leadership** requires relentless advocacy, real-world insight, and tight collaboration across global teams.
