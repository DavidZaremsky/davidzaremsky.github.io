# Bridging UX and Frontend Development  

## Overview  
My background in frontend engineering has been invaluable in ensuring **designs are not just visually appealing, but also practical, accessible, and performant**.  

## How UX and Frontend Intersect  

### **Ensuring Usability in Code**  
- Used **React and Angular** to build UI components that align with UX best practices.  
- Implemented **keyboard navigation & screen reader support** for accessibility.  

### **Design-Development Collaboration**  
- Worked closely with designers to translate **static mockups into functional interfaces**.  
- Provided **technical feasibility feedback** early in the design process.  

### **Performance & User Experience**  
- Optimized front-end performance to **reduce load times and improve responsiveness**.  
- Ensured UI consistency by advocating for **design system adoption in code**.  

## Impact  
✅ **Improved collaboration** between designers and engineers.  
✅ **More accessible, performant interfaces** by integrating UX principles into development.  
✅ **Better design fidelity** in implementation due to early UX involvement.  

## Key Takeaways  
- **Understanding front-end tech** helps UX designers create feasible solutions.  
- **Prototyping in code** can bridge the gap between design and development.  
- **Performance and accessibility** should be core UX considerations, not afterthoughts.
